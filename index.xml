In particular this very Basic Documentation of [[activity hub]]
and I was struck by how different things could have been on [[the internet]].
I Tooted about it:
Like literally how did we all agree to just NOT have interoperable social networks??? Looking at the activity pub docs makes it clear how ridiculously easy that would have been.</description></item><item><title>How this Site Works</title><link>/pages/how-this-site-works/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/how-this-site-works/</guid><description>Huh.

Clicking the graph button creates a word cloud for all times I&amp;rsquo;ve linked to that page. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice because in logseq, essentially anything can be a page, and I have a lot of pages for specific parts of my life:

There is a lot of good thinking on them over here on the Digital Gardeners Repo. [[Maggie Appleton]], prolific digital gardener and originator of the above repository, has written an excellent primer on the etymology and history of digital gardens. Here are one notable excerpts describing the concept:
Digital Gardens are not following the same conventions as what we&amp;rsquo;ve come to know as the &amp;ldquo;personal blog&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Futures</title><link>/pages/futures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/futures/</guid><description>How this Site Works How this Site Works

Many Worlds Card Sheet Figma Notes
First idea
What if there was some sort of game that was sort of like a tarrot deck, sort of like a trading card game, sort of like a world building rpg where you played driving forces, events or things from your hand and used them to shape the history of a world and imagine it&amp;rsquo;s future?</description></item><item><title>Player Indigo Games</title><link>/pages/player-indigo-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/player-indigo-games/</guid><description>Howdy! Here&amp;rsquo;s all the versions of the game I&amp;rsquo;m making for the [[Player Indigo Residency]]
I&amp;rsquo;m using this as a chance to really develop my [[itp/Thesis]] and I&amp;rsquo;m walking into this trying to make an iteration of a Many Worlds Game
Namely I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make:
A divination tool and deck building cardgame for embodying pasts, imagining futures and articulating alternate civilizations
I want to create a divination deck or collaborative storytelling ttrpg with cardbased deck building that helps players tell the story of an entire civilization in single sitting.</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>/archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/</guid><description>archives</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/search/</guid><description>search</description></item></channel></rss>
