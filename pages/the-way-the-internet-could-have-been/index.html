  + Something then particularly interesting is the idea that a [[logseq]] graph could in turn just be a [[federated]] [[mastadon]] server. Or a feed.

    + Essentially the idea then that each block could be a published activity. Could live as an activity / a toot

    + That a server could really just be a [[Graph Database]]

    + and [[wikilink]] and [[hashtags]] are equivalent.

    + That data should just be [[interoperable]], it should be [[immutable]].

        + Also what if you could just look at people as their handles- like as pages in logseq.
