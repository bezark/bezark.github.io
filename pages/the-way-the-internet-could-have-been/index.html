Looking at the activity pub docs makes it clear how ridiculously easy that would have been. You want my content? Just GET my outbox. Want to send me something? Just POST to my inbox. The server can be anything you want, just format your messages in this (VERY INTUITIVE!) way. It&rsquo;s so simple it&rsquo;s STUPID.
I&rsquo;m very new to all of this, so I&rsquo;ll admit that there&rsquo;s a lot I don&rsquo;t know, but what is painfully obvious right now is how, yet again, the tendrils of Capitalism have fundamentally altered the STRUCTURE of the Internet to make it less open, less empowering and generally WORSE for most users. However, what&rsquo;s also becoming clear is that it does not have to be that way, and being here is in some small way, bringing about that better possible future.</p><pre><code>+ 

+ And it's really true...

  + Something then particularly interesting is the idea that a [[logseq]] graph could in turn just be a [[federated]] [[mastadon]] server. Or a feed.

    + Essentially the idea then that each block could be a published activity. Could live as an activity / a toot

    + That a server could really just be a [[Graph Database]]

    + and [[wikilink]] and [[hashtags]] are equivalent.

    + That data should just be [[interoperable]], it should be [[immutable]].
      + I obviously don't mean that it should be unable to be deleted

        + Also what if you could just look at people as their handles- like as pages in logseq.
